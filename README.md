# go-bloggy

![Go](https://github.com/tugberkugurlu/go-bloggy/workflows/Go/badge.svg?branch=master)

Trying out stale bot...

Markdown-driven version of [tugberkugurlu/tugberk-web](https://github.com/tugberkugurlu/tugberk-web), implemented in [Go](https://go.dev/). 

## Facts

 - This codebase structure is influenced by [golang-standards/project-layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout), 
 even if it doesn't adhere to it completely.

## Build Docker Image

```
docker build -t my-golang-app -f docker-web.dockerfile .
docker run -it --rm -p 9000:8080 --name my-running-app my-golang-app
curl http://localhost:9000
```

You can connect to the running container like below to inspect, where `web` is the name of the container:

```
docker exec -it web bash
```

## Thanks

Huge thanks to below open source projects which helped me get this site up and running more quickly üôáüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
