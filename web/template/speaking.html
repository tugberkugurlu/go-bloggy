                    🗣 I frequently participate at conferences as a speaker to talk about technical leadership, software
                    architecture, lean software development, DevOps, Microsoft Azure and .NET.

                <p>
                    The biggest motivation for me to engage in public speaking is to learn more as I am big believer of
                    learning by teaching. I have also been benefiting from the openness of the software development
                    community and volunteering for public speaking is one of my ways of giving something back to show
                    my appreciation and stay part of this great community 🙌
