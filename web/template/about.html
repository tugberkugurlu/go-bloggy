                I'm an experienced Software Engineer with a growth mindset belief and 10+ years of practical software engineering experience 
                including technical leadership and distributed systems. I have a passion to create impactful software products, and I care 
                about usability, reliability, observability and scalability of the software systems that I work on, as much as caring about 
                day-to-day effectiveness, productivity and happiness of the team that I work with.

                I occasionally <a href="https://www.tugberkugurlu.com/speaking">speak at international conferences</a>, and write 
                technical posts on <a href="https://www.tugberkugurlu.com/archive">my blog</a>.

                I worked at companies such as Meta (fka Facebook), and Deliveroo where I gained experience on data-intensive 
                distributed systems which had high throughput, low latency and high availability needs. I also worked at Redgate for 4 years 
                as a Technical Lean and line-managed a team of 5 Software Engineers. There, I gained extensive experience on developing tools 
                for developers and database administrators.
