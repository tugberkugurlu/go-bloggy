                I'm a Senior Software Engineer and Tech Lead, with a growth mindset belief and 10+ years of practical software
                engineering experience including technical leadership and distributed systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a passion to create impactful software products, and I care about usability, reliability, observability
                and scalability of the software systems that I work on, as much as caring about day-to-day effectiveness,
                productivity and happiness of the team that I work with. I occasionally
                <a href="https://www.tugberkugurlu.com/speaking">speak at international conferences</a>, and write technical posts
                on <a href="https://www.tugberkugurlu.com/archive">my blog</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I currently work at Meta (Facebook) as a Software Engineer. I used to work at <a href="https://deliveroo.engineering/" target="_blank">Deliveroo</a> in
                London as a Staff Software Engineer in the Consumer division, working on distributed backend systems which have high throughput, low latency and high availability needs.
                Before that, I used to work at <a href="https://www.red-gate.com/" target="_blank">Redgate</a> as a Technical Lead for 4 years, where
                I led and line-managed a team of Software Engineers. I was responsible for all aspects of the products delivered by the team from
                technical architecture to product direction as well as making sure that the team had the right level of coaching/mentoring support.
                I was also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170625123630/https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/4039968?fullName=ali%20tugberk%20ugurlu">
                    a Microsoft MVP for 7 years between 2012-2019 on Microsoft development technologies.
