<p>I have used <a target="_blank" title="NuGet Package Manager Console" href="http://nuget.codeplex.com">NuGet</a> a lot with this project and I cannot imagine life without NuGet now :D This must be the major side affect of the NuGet, I guess :)</p>
<p>I have implemented lots of new features and I realized that I have improved a lot because now I consider the fact that people needs to reach the information in a very easy way. So I created tags section, archive section and internal search.</p>
<p>Also, I noticed that registration is lame and so I enabled comments to anyone. You do not need to log into system in order to leave a comment, just do it.</p>

<p><em>I thought that deployment would be the most annoying part since I have shared hosting (because no one is willing to support me :)) but the Visual Studio 2010 make it so easy for me with publish web site button! I just configured the publish wizard and the IDE did all the work. The hostng firm doesn't support the MVC 3 as I imagined so I need to do a little trick there. I coppied the essential dll files for MVC 3 application into my bin folder.</em></p>

<p>Ok, guys. Let's see how long I could stand up with this web site :)</p>
