<p><img style="border: 1px gray solid; height: 220px; float: left; margin: 10px; margin-left: 0; margin-top: 0;" id="Dexter-season-5-trailer" alt="Dexter sEason 5 photo" src="http://images.buddytv.com/articles/dexyter=comiccocn.jpg" /> The perfect moment has come... Every Dexter fan has shocked for the final scene of season 4 with <span style="font-style: italic;">"horny"</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">"annoying"</span> wife rita's tragic death. By then, nobody might have not anticipated that could be happen. <br /> And here is the time of Dexter Season 5... Everybody have waited for long time for Dexter Season 5 Trailer. It looks like we will be "again" take our breaths while watching Dexter.<br /> <img style="border: 1px gray solid; float: right; margin: 10px; margin-right: 0;" id="Dexter-season-5-trailer-comic-con" alt="Dexter sEason 5 photo Comic con michael c hall" src="http://www.sho.com/site/dexter/season4/images/home/promos/323_5_0_ext14.jpg" /><br /> Here is my prediction for season 5;<br /> <br /> Dexter is going to get caught. Some one this season will find out who he is. His last kill last season was too sloppy. Too many loose ends. My gusess is that either Quin or Deb will find out. Also his secret about his borther's death will be revealed in my opinion. But this is so sure when you watch the premier that quinn will be either second james doakes or first sergeant buzz-kill who will be the pain in the Dexter's ass. I cannot wait until 26<span style="vertical-align: super;">th</span> of September for the first episode. Maybe I will freeze myself in my refrigerator just like Cartman did while waiting for Nintetndo Wii to come out&nbsp;<img src="http://www.tugberkugurlu.com/Content/App_Icons/HTMLEditor.icons/grin.gif" /><br /> <br /> Your could wath Dexter Season 5 Premier at Showtime.
