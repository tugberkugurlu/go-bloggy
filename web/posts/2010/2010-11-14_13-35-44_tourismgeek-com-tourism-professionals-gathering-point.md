<p>For over a month, I have been working on an ASP.Net MVC 2.0 Project&nbsp;which will be a blog spot for tourism professionals. If all goes as planned, it will be online at the beginning of new year !&nbsp;<br /> <br /> The website will a multilingual website and it will offers greate amonth of academical tourism resources. TourismGeek.Com will not be blog website of a person, it will be the&nbsp;collection of artciles from tourism profecionals, experts and undergraduate students.<br /> <br /> <br /> <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Brief Information About TourismGeek.Com and Introduction<br /> </span></p>
<hr />
<p>TourismGeek.Com is not a web site. It would be so insulting to call it <i>'web site'</i> ! Then, what is this ? Here some of the explanatory words that I've come up with but not sure if they fit;</p>
<div style="margin: 10px 0 0 0;">
<ul class="floathy-ul">
<li>Tourism article database</li>
<li>Tourism community gathering place</li>
<li>The thing that tugberk has created to satisfy his egos ! (Most likely to me !)</li>
<li>Best friend of a toruism student, an intern and even an expert...</li>
</ul>
After a couple of days, you will figure out on your own what this web site is. So there is no need you to understand it now ! <br /> <br /> The articles you will see on this website will be all about tourism or a major which is somehow related to tourism (economics, business administration, computer science, etc.) and written by toursim professionals (experts, lecturers, undergraduate students, etc.). <br /> <br /> One of the main aim of this web site [not that there are so many aims of it :)] is to make the information easily reachable. How so? Let's see;<br /> <br /> 
<ul>
<li>The articles of the professionals will be under tourismgeek.com/{here is the article number} ! For instance, tourismgeek.com/100 ! That easy ! Not complex, crazy, mind exploding urls !</li>
<li>Professionals writting on this website has a single profile. Wanna see their profile? Easy ! Browse this : tourismgeek.com/{here is the user name of the professional} ! For instance, tourismgeek.com/tugberk ! That easy ! Not complex, crazy, mind exploding urls !</li>
<li>Looking for something specific? Easy ! Write it on the search box on the top-right side and search !</li>
</ul>
<br /> We will rumble with tourismgeek.com soon !</div>
