<p>I have a few speaking activities lined up in upcoming weeks and I thought it would be good to share those with you all :) I am very excited about them as I don’t have much international speaking experience and these will be a really good learning opportunities for me, while having a chance to share the knowledge at the same time. As you can imagine, most of these talks are related to <a href="https://www.tugberkugurlu.com/tags/asp-net-5">ASP.NET 5</a> which is the best thing that has happened to .NET Web stack if you ask me :) Here are all of them:</p> <h3>/dev/summer 2015, Cambridge (27<sup>th</sup> of June)</h3> <p>/dev/summer is of the great developer events in Cambridge and it happens twice a year. I was lucky to attend the /dev/winter 2015 this year and I am looking forward to <a href="http://devcycles.net/2015/summer/">/dev/summer 2015</a>, too. I will be <a href="http://devcycles.net/2015/summer/sessions/index.php?session=18">talking about DLM (Database Lifecycle Management)</a> and I will try to set a clear understanding of the advantages of embracing DLM, where your process fits today and how you can apply the described patterns and practices.

I will be giving two talks on the last day of the event and both of them are about ASP.NET 5. The first one is titled as "<strong>ASP.NET 5: How to Get Your Cheese Back</strong>" which I will talk about the biggest, drastic changes in the upcoming version of ASP.NET but I will try to prove that these changes will make you smile. The next one is "<strong>Going Further with ASP.NET 5</strong>" which will be slides-free, dig-deep-into-the-bowels-of-this-new-runtime kind of talk.
