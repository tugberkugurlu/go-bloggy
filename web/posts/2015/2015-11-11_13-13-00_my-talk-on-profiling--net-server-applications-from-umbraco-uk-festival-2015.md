<p>I was at <a href="http://umbracoukfestival.co.uk/">Umbraco UK Festival 2015</a> in London a few weeks ago to give a talk on Profiling .NET Server Applications. It was a really great experience for me as this was my first time presenting on this topic which I love and enjoy very much. Also, the conference venue was a church which made it really interesting for a presentation and I would be lying if I tell you that I didnâ€™t feel like a deacon up there on the stage :) The fantastic news is that all sessions were recorded and <a href="http://us1.campaign-archive2.com/?u=440351ed8bbab4acaf02ff9eb&amp;id=4d1b6b04bf">all of them are available to watch now</a> including my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEZKXRWDv60">Profiling .NET Server Applications</a> talk:</p> <p><iframe height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OEZKXRWDv60" frameborder="0" width="560" allowfullscreen></iframe></p> <p>You can find <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/tourismgeek/profiling-net-server-applications">the slides</a> under <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/tourismgeek">my Speaker Deck account</a> and I also encourage you to download the <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/dotnet-tips">free e-book which gives you 52 quick tips and tricks for .NET application performance</a>:</p> <p><a href="http://www.red-gate.com/dotnet-tips"><img title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="https://tugberkugurlu.blob.core.windows.net/bloggyimages/32748de0-351f-4d39-ad71-c48af0a05c7c.png" width="131" height="241"></a></p> <p>Finally, here are some further resources to look at if the talk was interesting for you: </p> <ul> <li><a href="http://bit.ly/1LYO86Y">ANTS Performance Profiler and ASP.NET 5</a></li> <li><a href="http://bit.ly/1Wiv08B">ASP.NET 5 Log Correlation</a></li> <li><a href="http://bit.ly/1HfbTWi">Assembly Memory Leak Sample</a></li> <li><a href="http://bit.ly/1M0rEm7">Memory Profiling an Application on IIS</a></li> <li><a href="http://bit.ly/1LFiuNO">Performance Counters with PowerShell</a></li> <li><a href="https://vimeo.com/113632451">Everything you need to know about .NET memory</a></li> <li><a href="http://bit.ly/1WmqJB2">Diving into Diagnostics on ASP.NET 5</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash">Logstash</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/2.0/input-plugins.html">Logstash Input Plugins</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/2.0/output-plugins.html">Logstash Output Plugins</a></li></ul>
