<p>I am really excited that I will be speaking at <a href="http://webnextconf.eu/">Web European Conference</a> 2015 in Milan on the 26th of September.</p> <p><a href="https://tugberkugurlu.blob.core.windows.net/bloggyimages/52257f78-e6de-47d2-997c-64b4036da55f.png"><img title="web-euro-conf" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="web-euro-conf" src="https://tugberkugurlu.blob.core.windows.net/bloggyimages/fff0a443-822e-4a8f-a99d-d752696781cb.png" width="1028" height="404"></a></p> <p>If you haven't heard of Web European Conference before, here is the description I am copying from the official web site:</p> <blockquote> <p>The first European Conference dedicated to the future of Development on all technologies. Everything about the newest and coolest framework for building modern web applications and websites: ASP.NET vNext, node.js, ruby, angular.js and much more.</p></blockquote> <p>You can view the conference <a href="http://blog.webnextconf.eu/2015/08/13/agenda-hotel-discounts/">schedule</a> <a href="http://webnextconf.eu/#schedule">here</a>. Just look at the details of the conference and ask this question: how more awesome can a conference be? It's all about Web, it's in Milan and the keynote speaker is <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/">Scott Hanselman</a> :)</p> <p>I will give a talk on getting into the bowels of ASP.NET 5. It should be fun. For the talk, I will assume that you have a prior knowledge on ASP.NET 5, and know how it’s different from its previous versions. If you want to benefit from this session and haven't got the chance to get up to speed wıth ASP.NET 5 yet, here are a few links to help you:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://docs.asp.net/en/latest/conceptual-overview/aspnet.html">Introduction to ASP.NET 5</a></li> <li><a href="http://docs.asp.net/en/latest/dnx/overview.html">DNX Overview</a></li> <li><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2015/2-687">Introducing ASP.NET 5</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/aspnet">ASP.NET GitHub Org</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/aspnet/Home">ASP.NET Home Repository</a></li> <li><a href="http://docs.asp.net/">ASP.NET 5 Docs</a></li></ul> <p>Looking at web site now and it seems like you still have <a href="http://webnextconf.eu/#price">a chance to register</a>. I hope to see you there :)</p>
