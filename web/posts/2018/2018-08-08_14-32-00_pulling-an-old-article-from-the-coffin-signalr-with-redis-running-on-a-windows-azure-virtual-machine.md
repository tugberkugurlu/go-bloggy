title: 'Pulling an Old Article From the Coffin: SignalR with Redis Running on a Windows
  Azure Virtual Machine'
abstract: Long time ago (about 5 years, at least), I contributed an article to SignalR
  wiki about scaling SignalR with Redis. You can still find the article here. I also
  blogged about it here. However, over time, pictures got lost there. I got a few
  requests from my readers to refresh those images and I was luckily able to find
  them :) I decided to publish that article here so that I would have a much better
  control over the content.
