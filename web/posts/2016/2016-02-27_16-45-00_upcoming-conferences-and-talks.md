<p>I am going to be at a few conferences in upcoming weeks and I would like to share them here with you. Main objective here is to tell you about where I am going to be and this should help meeting new people and learning about different experiences. <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremybytes">Jeremy Clark</a>, a friend I met at <a href="https://www.tugberkugurlu.com/archive/my-summary-of-codemash-2016">Codemash 2016</a>, has an amazing blog post on <a href="http://jeremybytes.blogspot.co.uk/2014/12/becoming-social-developer-guide-for.html">becoming a social developer</a>. I encourage you to check that out to see why and how.</p> <h3>DevConf, Johannesburg (8<sup>th</sup> of March)</h3> <p><a href="https://tugberkugurlu.blob.core.windows.net/bloggyimages/2a585442-038c-44bd-8633-e7e124b1efd8.png"><img title="devconf" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="devconf" src="https://tugberkugurlu.blob.core.windows.net/bloggyimages/26dd1138-9c7b-466d-a21c-7be92137293a.png" width="644" height="233"></a></p> <p>I am very, very excited about <a href="http://www.devconf.co.za/">DevConf</a>. Source of this excitement is the talk I will deliver there and the content of the conference. I will be presenting on <strong>architecting polyglot-persistent solutions</strong> as part of the Persistence and Data track. This is a topic which is very close to my heart as I had the first hand experience while working on <a href="http://zleek.com">Zleek</a> on what a big difference this type of architecture can make on your software product. It will also be the first time I will deliver this talk.</p> <p><a href="http://www.devconf.co.za/#speakers">Rest of the agenda</a> also looks pretty impressive. So, I am sure this will be well worth the long trip to South Africa :)</p> <h3>Microsoft Build 2016, San Francisco (30<sup>th</sup> of March - 1<sup>st</sup> of April)</h3> <p><a href="https://tugberkugurlu.blob.core.windows.net/bloggyimages/6f68f35b-a7fe-411a-bc86-512fd4cbd03e.png"><img title="image" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="https://tugberkugurlu.blob.core.windows.net/bloggyimages/a64148fc-cae2-4e46-8d7f-e59c82dfc787.png" width="644" height="229"></a></p> <p>At the end of March, I will also be in San Francisco to attend <a href="http://build.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Build conference</a>. This is also very exciting for several reasons. Obvious one is that there will be a lot of existing and soon-to-be friends there from the community and this is a very developer centric conference in view of Microsoft products. Also, I don't get to attend conferences that often as an attendee. I am sure I will feel the comfort of gliding through the session rooms and not trying to prepare for a talk. If you add the fact that this is going to be my first trip to San Francisco, it will be a real fun :)</p> <p>Last year, <a href="https://www.tugberkugurlu.com/archive/first-hours-with-visual-studio-code-on-mac-and-windows">my wish for Build Conference announcements came true with Visual Studio Code</a> and I am very much looking forward to this year's announcements, too.</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">interesting to see this just a month before <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Build2016?src=hash">#Build2016</a>. This took my expectations to a higher level for announcments <a href="https://t.co/uefSFy6atX">https://t.co/uefSFy6atX</a></p>â€” Tugberk Ugurlu (@tourismgeek) <a href="https://twitter.com/tourismgeek/status/702576763021324288">February 24, 2016</a></blockquote> <h3>I T.A.K.E. Unconference 2016, Bucharest (19<sup>th</sup> - 20<sup>th</sup> of May)</h3> <p><a href="https://tugberkugurlu.blob.core.windows.net/bloggyimages/24079636-3483-4424-8c22-eb011d3cfb2c.png"><img title="image" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="https://tugberkugurlu.blob.core.windows.net/bloggyimages/16d5f0e0-736f-480b-a875-3f467a7b34a6.png" width="644" height="285"></a></p> <p>At <a href="http://itakeunconf.com/">I T.A.K.E. Unconference 2016</a>, I will talk about two very interesting topics and I think both of them are very interesting considering the type of software solutions and the way we produce them nowadays.</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://itakeunconf.com/sessions/how-docker-changes-the-way-you-work-with-and-release-your-microservices/">How Docker Changes the Way You Work with and Release Your Microservices</a></li> <li><a href="http://itakeunconf.com/sessions/zero-downtime-deployment-golden-rules/">Zero Downtime Deployment Golden Rules</a></li></ul> <p>I am very much looking forward both of them since it's going to be the first time that I present these sessions. It seems like <a href="http://itakeunconf.com/register/">it's still possible to register</a> and you can also check the rest of the schedule out <a href="http://itakeunconf.com/schedule/">here</a>.</p> <p>If you are going to be around for any of the above events, <a href="https://twitter.com/tourismgeek">let's meet and say hi</a> to each other :)</p>
