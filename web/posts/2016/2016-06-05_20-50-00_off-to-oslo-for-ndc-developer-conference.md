<p>Next week, I am off to Oslo for one of my favorite conferences: <a href="http://ndcoslo.com/">NDC Oslo</a>. <a href="http://www.tugberkugurlu.com/archive/ndc-oslo-2014-bullet-points">I have been to NDC Oslo before in 2014</a> but this time is a little bit more special as I am <a href="http://ndcoslo.com/speaker/tugberk-ugurlu/">one of the speakers this year</a>. Seeing the <a href="http://ndcoslo.com/speakers/">list of awesome speakers at conference</a> makes me so excited and nervous at the same time :)</p> <p>As for my topic, I am going to be talking about <a href="http://ndcoslo.com/talk/getting-into-the-zero-downtime-deployment-world/">zero-downtime deployments</a>. I will tell you about some patterns, practices and techniques that make it this challenging task easier, such as semantic versioning and blue/green deployments. Weâ€™ll also walk through an end-to-end demo of how a high traffic web application can survive the challenge of deployments. If you are going to be there, I hope you will also join me at my talk. </p> <p><a href="https://tugberkugurlu.blob.core.windows.net/bloggyimages/78284f34-a517-4221-a6f3-af35b8000e2a.png"><img title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="https://tugberkugurlu.blob.core.windows.net/bloggyimages/bddd5a7e-5424-4ede-804f-e0b9a0150439.png" width="644" height="421"></a></p> <p>I can see <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ndcoslo&amp;src=tyah">lots of people from my Twitter timeline already tweeting about NDC Oslo</a>. So, I am really sure that this is going to be an exciting event. I hope to see lots of friends and make new friends while I am there. See you in Oslo :)</p>
