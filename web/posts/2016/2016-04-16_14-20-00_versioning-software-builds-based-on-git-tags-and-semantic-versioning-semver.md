title: Versioning Software Builds Based on Git Tags and Semantic Versioning (SemVer)
abstract: I have been using a technique to set the build version on my CI (continuous
  integration) system, Travis CI, based on Git tags and semantic versioning (SemVer).
  In this post, I want to share this with you and give you an implementation of that
  in Bash.
