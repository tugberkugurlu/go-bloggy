<p>Attending a developer conference is an amazing way to start a new year. <a href="http://www.tugberkugurlu.com/tags/geek-talks">I love conferences</a> because it’s where I learn the most. I am a believer of experience driven life and the conferences is the best place where you can learn about other people’s experiences and different cultures. 2016 will start for me with <a href="https://www.codemash.org/">CodeMash</a>, a unique event that will educate developers on current practices, methodologies, and technology trends in a variety of platforms and development languages such as Java, .NET, Ruby, Python and PHP. The conference will be held in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandusky,_Ohio">Sandusky, Ohio</a> between 5th and 8th of January, 2016. I will be talking about two topics at the conference and both of those talks will be held on the last day of the conference, 8th of January, Friday.</p> <p><a href="https://tugberkugurlu.blob.core.windows.net/bloggyimages/a7f1ad25-5e44-468f-8995-cc16a26fd7b7.png"><img title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="https://tugberkugurlu.blob.core.windows.net/bloggyimages/38db18e4-ce65-42b1-bbba-860d48f5e404.png" width="644" height="280"></a></p> <p>First one is at 08:30 AM: <a href="https://www.codemash.org/session/asp-net-5-how-to-get-your-cheese-back/">ASP.NET 5: How to Get Your Cheese Back</a>. This is mainly targeted for people who are interested in learning what are the main reasons to adopt <a href="http://www.tugberkugurlu.com/tags/asp-net-5">ASP.NET 5</a> and what it will bring to the table. Even if you haven’t done any .NET development before, you will still find a lot of interesting things here as I believe that one of the biggest advantage of the new .NET ecosystem is that there are no big entry barriers for newcommers anymore.</p> <p>My last talk is going to be on DLM (<a href="https://www.red-gate.com/products/dlm/">Database Lifecycle Management</a>), at 11:00 AM: <a href="https://www.codemash.org/session/database-lifecycle-management-getting-it-right/">Database Lifecycle Management: Getting it Right</a>. If you are working with an RDBMS in your daily job and want to automate the release process of the changes, you will definitely find something valuable in this talk. I will be mainly giving the examples for SQL Server changes by using <a href="https://www.red-gate.com/products/dlm/dlm-automation-suite/">DLM Automation Suite</a> tools but this talk is not about tools and SQL Server. It’s all about concepts and challenges of managing the lifecycle of the database schema.</p> <p>Unfortunately, I will be able to only attend the last two days of the conference but that’s better than nothing. I am so excited about the conference and if you are going to be there, ping me (through <a href="https://twitter.com/tourismgeek">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tugberk">LinkedIn</a>, etc.) to have a chat and meet. See you there :)</p>
