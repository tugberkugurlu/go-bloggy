title: Having a Look at dotnet CLI Tool and .NET Native Compilation in Linux
abstract: dotnet CLI tool can be used for building .NET Core apps and for building
  libraries through your development flow (compiling, NuGet package management, running,
  testing, etc.) on various operating systems. Today, I will be looking at this tool
  in Linux, specifically its native compilation feature.
