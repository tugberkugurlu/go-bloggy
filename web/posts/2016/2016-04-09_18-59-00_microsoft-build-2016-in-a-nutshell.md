<p>Two weeks ago, I had an amazing opportunity to be at <a href="https://build.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Build Conference</a> in San Francisco as an attendee thanks to my amazing company <a href="http://red-gate.com">Redgate</a>. The experience was truly unique and amount of people I have met there was huge. A bit late but I would like to share my experience about the conference with you in this post by highlighting what has happened and giving you my personal takeaways. You can also check out <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Build2016%20from%3Atourismgeek&amp;src=typd&amp;lang=en-gb">my tweets for the Build conference</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://tugberkugurlu.blob.core.windows.net/bloggyimages/45aa511c-c2bc-4d3d-9ff4-a0a3dab90c17.jpg"><img title="CeznGcRWAAE_QMw" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="CeznGcRWAAE_QMw" src="https://tugberkugurlu.blob.core.windows.net/bloggyimages/e2483a7d-be8c-4a7f-b899-a85e2f1ea3b2.jpg" width="644" height="484"></a></p> <h3>Announcements</h3> <p>There were bunch of big and small announcements throughout the conference from Microsoft. Some of these were highlighted during two keynotes and some other announcements were spread to three days. I tried to capture all of them here but it's very likely I missed some of them (mostly the small ones): <p><a href="https://tugberkugurlu.blob.core.windows.net/bloggyimages/c6505439-75c2-40df-a918-d0eb06171fbf.jpg"><img title="Ce46IwXUsAA0Wil" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Ce46IwXUsAA0Wil" src="https://tugberkugurlu.blob.core.windows.net/bloggyimages/57a660df-46d1-4fd6-8a9e-05b5d6c8d914.jpg" width="644" height="403"></a> <ul> <li><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/03/30/run-bash-on-ubuntu-on-windows/">Running Bash on Ubuntu on Windows</a> has been announced. This is not something like Cygwin or anything. It basically runs Ubuntu on Windows without the Unix kernel. So, the things we all love like apt-get works as you expect it to work. This is a new developer feature included in a Windows 10 "Anniversary" update which is coming soon (as they say). You can watch <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/P488">Running Bash on Ubuntu on Windows</a> video, check <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/T650-R1">Windows Command Line Improvements</a> session from Build 2016 or <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/C906">Scott Hanselman's Channel 9 interview on Linux Command Line on Windows</a>.</li></ul> <ul> <li><a href="https://blog.xamarin.com/xamarin-for-all/">Xamarin in Visual Studio is now available at no extra cost</a>. Xamarin will be in every edition of Visual Studio, including the widely-available Visual Studio Community Edition, which is <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/support/legal/mt171547">free for individual developers, open source projects, academic research, education, and small professional teams</a>.

This still requires a Mac to build the project AFAIK. <li>Mono Project is now part of the <a href="http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/">.NET Foundation</a> and is now under MIT License.</li></ul> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/news/vs2015-update2-vs">Visual Studio 2015 Update 2</a> RTM has been made available to public. <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2016/03/30/visual-studio-2015-update-2-rtm/">You can read more about this on VS Blog</a>. <li><a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/news/vs15-preview-vs">Visual Studio "15" Preview</a> has been made available to public. This is different than VS 2015 and has a very straight forward <u>install experience</u>. I recommend watching <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/B859">The Future of Visual Studio</a> session or <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/C908">The Future of Visual Studio Channel 9 live interview</a> from Build 2016 or read <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2016/03/30/visual-studio-15-preview/">Visual Studio “15” Preview Now Available</a> blog post if you want to learn more. <li>Related to both VS 2015 Update 2 and VS 15 Preview, see <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/04/02/whats-new-for-c-and-vb-in-visual-studio/">What’s New for C# and VB in Visual Studio</a> post on .NET Blog.

This service is exposing several machine learning algorithms as a service and allows you to hook them into your apps through several HTTP based APIs like <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/computer-vision-api">Computer Vision API</a>. Some portions of this service was known as Project Oxford which was the codename. Try out <a href="https://www.captionbot.ai/">https://www.captionbot.ai/</a> which is built on top of these APIs. <li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/service-fabric/">Azure Service Fabric</a> has stepped outside the preview and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-service-fabric-is-ga/">is now GA</a>. Microsoft has given a lot of attention to this service throughout the conference, including <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/KEY02#time=52m42s">the keynote (starting from 0:52:42)</a>.

Debugging on Ubuntu through VS Preview 15 was my favorite of the session. <li><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/B881">What's New in TypeScript?</a>: It's always interesting and useful to watch Andres talking about languages. On this session, the part where he talk about non-nullable support on TypeScript was really beneficial. <li><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/B863">Building Resilient Services: Learning Lessons from Azure with Mark Russinovich</a>: This is like a tradition for build. Mark Rus. talked about architectural and design decisions on Azure platform, mostly driven from real use cases. <li><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/KEY02">Second Day Keynote</a> <li><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/B891">.NET Overview</a>: Very valuable session to understand <a href="https://twitter.com/tourismgeek/status/715670682684694528">the future of .NET</a>. <li><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/B810">Introducing ASP.NET Core 1.0</a>: Very basic intro on ASP.NET Core 1.0.

I find messaging on Data Lake a bit confusing. <li><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/B811">Deploying ASP.NET Core Applications</a>: Enjoyed this a lot, Dan laid out several cases in terms of deployment of ASP.NET Core applications.</li></ul> <p>As much as I wanted to attend some other sessions, I missed some of them mostly due to clashes with other sessions. Luckily <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016">recordings for all Build 2016 sessions are available up on Channel 9</a>. Here is my list of sessions to catch up: <ul> <li><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/B889">The Future of C#</a>: This was really entertaining and informative to watch and see what the future of C# might bring. <li><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/B823">Building Apps in Azure Using Windows and Linux VMs</a>: Really good overall picture on the current state of Azure IaaS <li><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/B836">Cross-Platform Mobile with Xamarin</a> <li><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/B840">Delivering Applications at Scale with DocumentDB, Azure's NoSQL Document Database</a> <li><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/B855">Microsoft Cognitive Services: Build smarter and more engaging experiences</a> <li><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/B860">Windows 10 IoT Core: From Maker to Market</a> <li><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/B875">Setting the Stage: The Application Platform in Windows Server 2016</a> <li><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/B858">Introducing Azure Functions</a> <li><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/B812">ASP.NET Core Deep Dive into MVC</a> <li><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/B805">Advanced Analytics with R and SQL</a> <li><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/P426">Using the Right Networking API for Your UWP App</a> <li><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/B814">SQL Database Technologies for Developers</a> <li><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/B822">Building Applications Using the Azure Container Service</a></li></ul> <p>There were also many good Channel 9 Live interviews.

Here is a personal list of a few which are worth listening to: <p><a href="https://tugberkugurlu.blob.core.windows.net/bloggyimages/5c5f4e93-f61a-4b57-a13c-4d9c56c548cb.jpg"><img title="IMG_1870" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="IMG_1870" src="https://tugberkugurlu.blob.core.windows.net/bloggyimages/05cc1782-1f67-40d9-be0f-a0679aafd71f.jpg" width="644" height="484"></a> <ul> <li><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/C907">Anders Live</a> <li><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/CJS1">Jeffrey Snover on Azure Stack, Powershell, and Nano Server</a> <li><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/C920">The Future of .NET Languages</a> <li><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/C906">Linux Command Line on Windows</a> <li><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/C908">The Future of Visual Studio</a> <li><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/C912">Moving Forward with ASP.NET</a> <li><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/Docker-Tooling-for-Visual-Studio-and-ASPNET-Core">Docker Tooling for Visual Studio and ASP.NET Core</a> <li><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/C916">Xamarin Live</a> <li><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/C918">Mark Russinovich Live</a> <li><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/C919">Data Science on Azure</a> <li><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/GS102">International Space Station Project</a></li></ul> <h3>Personal Takeaways</h3> <p>All in all it has been a great conference and as stated, I am still catching up on the stuff that I have missed. Throughout the conference, I have picked up a few key points and I want to end the post with those:</p> <ul> <li>I have seen more from Microsoft to make developers lives easier and more productive by enabling new tools (<a href="https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/03/30/run-bash-on-ubuntu-on-windows/">Bash on Ubuntu on Windows</a>), supporting multiple platforms (<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/service-fabric/">Service Fabric</a> to run on every environment including <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>, on-premises, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/overview/azure-stack/">Azure Stack</a> and preview of Service Fabric on Linux), open sourcing more (some parts of <a href="https://www.xamarin.com/">Xamarin</a> have gone open source) and making existing paid tools available for free (Xamarin is now free). <li>Microsoft is more focused on getting their existing services together and trying to give a cohesive ecosystem for developers. Service Fabric, Cognitive Services, Data Lake is a few examples of this. <li><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/corefx">.NET Core</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr">CoreCLR</a> is approaching to finalization for v1. After RC2, I don't suppose there will be much more features added or concepts changing. <li>I think this is the first time I have seen stabilization on client Apps story for Microsoft. <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/universal-application-platform-guide">Universal Windows Platform (UWP)</a> was the focus on this area this year and it was the same on previous year. <li>I am absolutely happy to see Microsoft abandoning Windows Phone day by day. There was no direct sessions on it during the conference. <li>There were more steps towards making software to manage people's lives in a better way. Skype Bot Framework was one of these steps. <li>Microsoft (mostly Azure group) invests on IoT solutions heavily. Azure Functions and new updates on <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/server-cloud/internet-of-things/azure-iot-suite.aspx">Azure IoT Suite</a> are just a few signs of this. <li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/documentation/articles/resource-group-overview/">Azure Resource Manager (ARM)</a> and ARM templates are getting a lot of love from Microsoft and it's the way they push forward. They even build new services on Azure on top of this.</li></ul>
