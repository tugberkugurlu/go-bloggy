title: ASP.NET Core Authentication in a Load Balanced Environment with HAProxy and
  Redis
abstract: Token based authentication is a fairly common way of authenticating a user
  for an HTTP application. However, handling this in a load balanced environment has
  always involved extra caring. In this post, I will show you how this is handled
  in ASP.NET Core by demonstrating it with HAProxy and Redis through the help of Docker.
