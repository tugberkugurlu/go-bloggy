<p>I had an amazing time in Johannesburg this week and had the privilege to attend <a href="http://www.devconf.co.za/">DevConf 2016</a> as a speaker. I got to travel to South Africa for the first time and I really liked the country, especially the food :) Also, I tried to be <a href="http://jeremybytes.blogspot.co.uk/2014/12/becoming-social-developer-guide-for.html">a social developer</a> and had a chance to meet with a few new amazing folks like <a href="https://twitter.com/colindembovsky">Colin Dembovsky</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/LisaBasel">Lisa Basel</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Tite_Chris">Chris Tite</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkPearlCoZa">Mark Pearl</a> and many others that I cannot remember right now after a few beers at Dubai airport while writing this blog post :)</p> <p>During the conference, I attended a few other talks apart from giving one. Here are all of them:</p> <ul> <li>A year of dealing with RabbitMQ</li> <li>Lap around Azure Machine Learning</li> <li>Getting Started with Analytics (GTM and GA)</li> <li>Brownfield TDD: How to eat an elephant?</li> <li>Adjust your behaviour and be surprised how much you can influence your team</li> <li>Building real world microservices using Node.js</li></ul> <p>I generally like to summarize my impressions I gained throughout the conference (e.g. <a href="https://www.tugberkugurlu.com/archive/my-summary-of-codemash-2016">Codemash 2016</a>, <a href="https://www.tugberkugurlu.com/archive/ndc-oslo-2014-bullet-points">NDC Oslo 2014</a>). Here are those from DevConf:</p> <ul> <li>People are pulling away from so-called Microsoft stack as much as it makes sense, especially on the data storage part. This is a good thing for everyone, even for Microsoft. Microsoft being more open has the biggest effect on this.  <li>People who experienced relational database architecture where the business logic sits inside the database seems to have learnt the lessons very well.  <li>Microservices had its appearance throughout the conference again :)  <li>Polyglot persistence seems to be what most of the people are applying today without knowing the term that much :) Not knowing the term is no problem at all. Remember: this type of terms (e.g. <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html">Microservices</a>) help communicate during planning processes and discussions easier.  <li>Application and <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/dlm/">Database Lifecycle management</a> is more about the culture and less about the tools. People who want to adopt this culture seek advice from consulting companies, they need tools just to get the job done. <li><a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/infrastructure-code-reason-smile">Infrastructure as code</a> is grabbing more and more attention.</li></ul> <h3>My Talk: Architecting Polyglot-persistent Solutions</h3> <p>Apart from a few logistical problems during my talk (like <a href="https://twitter.com/tourismgeek/status/707123586197295104">electricity going out completely</a>!), it was really good overall. This was very first time I have given this talk and it was based on the experience I had over a few years on <a href="http://zleek.com">Zleek</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://tugberkugurlu.blob.core.windows.net/bloggyimages/9a0d041e-6139-47e3-abdc-ec91511da453.jpg"><img title="2016-03-08 10.29.04" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="2016-03-08 10.29.04" src="https://tugberkugurlu.blob.core.windows.net/bloggyimages/c9bbd57d-1275-4517-b5b1-d85b022f3279.jpg" width="644" height="484"></a></p> <p>You can find the slides under <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/tourismgeek">my Speakerdeck account</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/tourismgeek/architecting-polyglot-persistent-solutions">here</a>. </p><script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="3474381924404553afdfbd7c8010fcfa" data-ratio="1.77777777777778" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script> <p>Here are also a few more links that you may find useful on this topic:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PolyglotPersistence.html">Polyglot Persistence by Martin Fowler</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/tugberkugurlu/ModernShopping">An evolving example on Polyglot Persistence</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.mongodb.com/presentations/webinar-mongodb-and-polyglot-persistence-architecture">Webinar: MongoDB and Polyglot Persistence Architecture</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.kennybastani.com/2015/08/polyglot-persistence-spring-cloud-docker.html">Building Microservices with Polyglot Persistence Using Spring Cloud and Docker</a></li> <li><a href="http://engineering.foursquare.com/2014/01/28/mongo-on-hadoop/">Mongo on Hadoop</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.tugberkugurlu.com/archive/getting-started-with-neo4j-in--net-with-neo4jclient-library">Getting Started with Neo4j in .NET with Neo4jClient Library</a></li></ul> <h3>Special Thanks</h3> <p>I would like to thank all the DevConf team who made this conference happen and all the audience for their amazing attention for the conference.
