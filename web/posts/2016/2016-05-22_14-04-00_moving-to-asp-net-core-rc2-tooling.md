title: 'Moving to ASP.NET Core RC2: Tooling'
abstract: .NET Core Runtime RC2 has been released a few days ago along with .NET Core
  SDK Preview 1. At the same time of .NET Core release, ASP.NET Core RC2 has also
  been released. While I am migrating my projects to RC2, I wanted to write about
  how I am getting each stage done. In this post, I will show you the tooling aspect
  of the changes.
