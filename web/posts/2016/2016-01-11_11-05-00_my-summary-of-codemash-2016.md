<p>I had the pleasure of <a href="https://www.tugberkugurlu.com/archive/speaking-at-codemash-2016-in-sandusky-ohio">attending CodeMash this year to give two talks</a>. The conference was generally good, there were lots of people from the several parts of the World and I got to meet a lot of smart and amazing people.</p> <p><a href="https://tugberkugurlu.blob.core.windows.net/bloggyimages/89d0a00d-f57a-41ab-9a94-051f7a3745d7.jpg"><img title="2016-01-08 17.08.27" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="2016-01-08 17.08.27" src="https://tugberkugurlu.blob.core.windows.net/bloggyimages/1f54d3b0-7866-439d-a0a7-0d1086aee7b8.jpg" width="644" height="289"></a></p> <p>I only had a chance to attend the last two days of the conference and during those days, I attended several talks and missed bunch of good ones (and there are no recordings which makes me sad):</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://www.codemash.org/session/docker-in-production-done-that-whats-next/">Docker in production? Done that, what’s next?</a>  <li><a href="http://www.codemash.org/session/the-code-behind-the-vulnerability/">The Code Behind the Vulnerability</a>  <li><a href="http://www.codemash.org/session/from-power-chords-to-power-of-models-insights-from-history-of-rock-music-via-machine-learning/">From Power Chords to Power of Models: Insights from History of Rock Music via Machine Learning</a>  <li><a href="http://www.codemash.org/session/from-developer-to-manager/">From Developer to Manager</a>  <li><a href="http://www.codemash.org/session/introducing-the-new-asp-net-authorization-and-data-protection-stacks/">Introducing the new ASP.NET Authorization and Data Protection Stacks</a>  <li><a href="http://www.codemash.org/session/fun-with-mind-reading-using-eeg-and-azure-machine-learning-to-perform-lie-detection/">Fun with Mind Reading: Using EEG and Azure Machine Learning to Perform Lie Detection</a>  <li><a href="http://www.codemash.org/session/cloud-design-patterns-for-scalability-and-performance/">Cloud Design Patterns for Scalability and Performance</a>  <li><a href="http://www.codemash.org/session/got-documents-an-exploration-of-document-databases-in-software-architecture/">Got Documents?

Especially, the <a href="https://twitter.com/jennifermarsman">Jennifer Marsman</a>’s session on combination of EEG + Machine Learning + Lie Detection was absolutely mind-blowing to watch. I don’t think I have blinked during the entire session :)</p> <p><a href="https://tugberkugurlu.blob.core.windows.net/bloggyimages/648ededb-8e63-403f-ad3b-5e40bd923d01.jpg"><img title="2016-01-07 14.29.14" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="2016-01-07 14.29.14" src="https://tugberkugurlu.blob.core.windows.net/bloggyimages/8da1d02a-01c5-43a1-941b-8b86787f37ea.jpg" width="644" height="484"></a></p> <p>Here are a few things I took away from the conference by attending sessions and talking to people:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PolyglotPersistence.html">Polyglot persistence</a> is a general topic of interest and people are leaning towards this road.  <li>People try to apply or understand <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html">Microservices</a> and its benefits.  <li><a href="https://www.tugberkugurlu.com/archive/playing-around-with-docker-hello-world-development-environment-and-your-application">Docker</a> makes the above two approaches easy to adopt and people are aware of that.  <li>Lots of concern around how to move to ASP.NET 5, especially to .NET Core.  <li>Machine learning opens up a lot of interesting possibilities for IoT products and service based solutions.  <li>Migrations based approach is definitely a must to have on the DLM process.</li></ul> <p>Lots of these are nice to see since they validated some of my thoughts and confirmed that I am on the right track. Some of them gave me new excitements and it didn’t take long to accept the challenges :)</p> <blockquote lang="en" class="twitter-tweet"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Late but better than never :) <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RaspberryPi?src=hash">#RaspberryPi</a> <a href="https://t.co/s5Yz0hnx4x">pic.twitter.com/s5Yz0hnx4x</a></p>— Tugberk Ugurlu (@tourismgeek) <a href="https://twitter.com/tourismgeek/status/686220320605356032">January 10, 2016</a></blockquote><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p>The best part of the conference was that I had a chance to meet lots of new people and put a face on some that I have known through Twitter like <a href="https://twitter.com/mj1856">Matt Johnson</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/blowdart">Barry Dorrans</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/darrel_miller">Darrel Miller</a> and lots of other amazing people.</p> <p>As mentioned in my previous post, I gave two talks on <a href="https://www.tugberkugurlu.com/tags/asp-net-5">ASP.NET 5</a> and <a href="https://www.red-gate.com/products/dlm/">Database Lifecycle Management</a>.

I want to thank CodeMash organizers for inviting me to speak at the conference. It was a really valuable opportunity for me to stand in front of that amazing crowd. I also want to thank <a href="https://www.red-gate.com/">Redgate</a> and for covering my travel expenses and sparing me for the time of the conference. I want to emphasize again that Redgate is an amazing company to be part of!</p> <blockquote> <p>Redgate has <a href="https://www.red-gate.com/our-company/careers/current-opportunities/">several opportunities</a> that might fit you. I highly encourage you to check them out.</p></blockquote> <p>I want to end this post with a reference to a tweet which shows the message <a href="https://twitter.com/reverentgeek">David Neal</a> gave at the end of his talk (which was the last talk of CodeMash):</p> <blockquote lang="en" class="twitter-tweet"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nice ending to the conf <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/codemash?src=hash">#codemash</a> <a href="https://t.co/dYrkC9Fq0h">pic.twitter.com/dYrkC9Fq0h</a></p>— Tugberk Ugurlu (@tourismgeek) <a href="https://twitter.com/tourismgeek/status/685577621023932416">January 8, 2016</a><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></blockquote>
