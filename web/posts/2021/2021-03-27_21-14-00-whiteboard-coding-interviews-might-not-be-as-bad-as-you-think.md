## TL;DR; Intro

Whiteboard style coding interviews (a.k.a. leetcode style, interviewing through CS trivia questions) has a bad reputation, and within the software industry they are being perceived as "bad interview practice" in general. Despite this perception, many companies (especially the top-tier tech companies, a.k.a. [FAANG](https://medium.com/dev-genius/whats-faang-a9561bb713e2) and the likes) still hire software engineers through this interviewing process. 

As someone who has conducted 100+ tech interviews within the last 4 years and also as someone who has failed this type of interviews nearly dozen times in the last 5 years, I would like to express my thoughts on why this perception might not be the most accurate one, why organizations still stick with this type of interviewing style, and also why this type of interviews can and should even be perceived positively by candidates.

In general, I do believe that gaining a different perspective on this type of interviewing processes will be helpful to all of us, mainly to understanding the problem which is aimed to be solved through this type of interview processes. This is not only for us to eventually accept the process as is, and move on with our lives. However, if we understand why the process exist today in the way it's, we will then be able to form a better judgment of the process from the perspective of both sides, and we can then challenge the assumptions, and influence a change if necessary.

> ⚠️ Disclaimer 2: I am acknowledging that interviewing is an area where quantifying the success of the certain interviewing processes is really challenging. Also, I am aware that all the information I will unleash here are not backed by any scientific evidence. However, they come from an experience. So, I still see it valuable to share. Nevertheless, take all this info in this post with a grain of salt.

## Types of Software Engineering Roles

I personally believe that figuring out what type of software engineer you will be in your new job is a multifaceted problem, and plays a crucial role on understanding the reasons behind the interview process of an organization. I want to touch on three of these dimensions to narrow down the focus of this post, and my hope is that this will eventually make it more clear what the problem of "whiteboard"-style interviews are trying solve.

### Specialist vs. Generalist

First of all, "Software Engineer" is a broad term, and it's common that we sometimes end up specializing within an area, e.g. Backend Engineer, Frontend Engineer, Engineer in Test, QA Engineer, iOS Engineer, Security Engineer, and so on or and so forth. The list can go on, but the truth is that each of these roles requires different skill sets even if all these will require the person to write code and implement software to a certain extent.

On the other hand, some organizations purposely hire "Software Engineers". This can vary from organization to organization what this mean but in general this refers to the generalist software engineer, where they are well-versed on solving problems through software without necessarily constraining themselves within a workflow. In my experience, even these hires end up specializing in one area of software engineering. However, these engineers can still contribute pretty much throughout the whole lifecycle of the software delivery process.

In general, an organization's chosen interview process can be very different when it comes to hiring a specialist vs. generalist, but they can still have some fundamental common characteristics. I will touch on this later in the post.
