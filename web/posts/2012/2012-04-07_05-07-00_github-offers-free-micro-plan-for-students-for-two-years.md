<p>As you already probably know, <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com" title="http://github.com">GitHub</a> is amazingly awesome and keeps beating crap out of others (cough, Codeplex, cough). As a company, they have a very unique organization and that amazes me as well. And I am also going to tell this: GitHub is not #1 because of the fact that they support Git. They are #1 because they know what we want and how important UX is for the overall quality.</p>
<p>Anyway, couple of days ago I came across that <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/edu" title="https://github.com/edu">GitHub offers Educational Accounts</a> for academic people (student, teacher, etc.) and that covers <strong>free micro plan </strong>for students for 2 years.</p>

<p>As I am (still!) a collage student, I filled up the form and sent it. I was expecting to be rejected since I thought they wouldn't accept students outside of the USA for this plan but they were very positive about it and set my account in a short time.</p>

<p>If you are student, go to <a href="https://github.com/edu">https://github.com/edu</a>, fill up the form indicating that you are a student, want to benefit from the free edu plan and get the micro plan as free of charge for two years.</p>
