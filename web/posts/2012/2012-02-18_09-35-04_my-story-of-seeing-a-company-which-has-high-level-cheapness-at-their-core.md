As you expected, I was starving and try to figure out how to <strong><em>have it my way</em></strong> there. At the end, I decided to have a burger menu.</p>
<p>Just after I ordered, I nicely asked one more tiny&nbsp;<span>mayonnaise and ketchup and the response that I got was unreasonably shocking and stupid. In a programmer's brain, it was a HTTP&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#509" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#509" target="_blank">509 Bandwidth Limit Exceeded</a>. The reason why this is stupid is not that they asked me extra money for that, because I have been going their restaurants pretty often and they responded nicely and tried to make my dreams come true if I request the same thing. Not to mention their stuff told me that this is the rule that they have been applying for nearly two years. That's lie and a big one.</span></p>
<p><span>In the middle of my day, t</span>his really hit me and<em> I thought that this was the lowest level a company can go down</em>. This shows how poor and cheap their service is and that they have no idea on how to train their stuff so that they behave the same way. I am not judging them for asking extra money for these little boxes of souce, this is their cheapness in my opinion unless a person abuses this. I mean it is reasonable to reject the request of the person if s/he asked for 100 boxes of&nbsp;mayonnaise and ketchup but for one more, this is the high level of cheapness my dear friend.</p>
<p><span>The funny part is that they told me I could have one special souce since I ordered Chicken Tenders along with the burgers. That sentence really made my day. I told them to keep it as my donation to their poor company so that the company can grow more and get rid of this cheapness.</span></p>
<p><span>I am writing this as a customer complaint and you, that restaurant, should take this into considiration.</span></p>
