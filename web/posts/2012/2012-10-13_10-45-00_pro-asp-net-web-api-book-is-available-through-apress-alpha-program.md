<p><a title="Pro ASP.NET Web API Book" href="http://www.apress.com/9781430247258"><img style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px; display: inline;" align="right" src="http://www.apress.com/media/catalog/product/cache/9/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/A/9/A9781430247258-3d.png" width="190" height="240" /></a>Since April 2012, me and <a href="http://blog.alexonasp.net/">Alexander Zeitler</a> have been working on a book for <a href="http://www.asp.net/web-api">ASP.NET Web API</a> which is a framework that makes it easy to build HTTP services that reach a broad range of clients, including browsers and mobile devices. Today, all of our efforts have come to fruition and I am proud to announce that the <a href="http://www.apress.com/9781430247258">Pro ASP.NET Web API book</a> is available through <a href="http://www.apress.com/alpha-products">Apress Alpha Program</a>.</p>
<p>I believe that we are producing an incredibly useful resource which any developer, who wants to leverage the ASP.NET Web API framework, needs under her/his hand. We aimed to avoid explaining and extracting implementation details of the framework as much as possible. Instead, we try to give more examples and use-cases for each component of the framework. There is also going to be a sample application walkthrough.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know what The Apress Alpha Program is, here is a little quote from <a href="http://www.apress.com/">Apress</a> web site:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>The Alpha Book Program</h3>
<p>Want to get an early look at our titles? Try an Alpha Book! An Alpha Book is a pre-release, still-in-development version of an Apress title. When you purchase an Alpha Book, you get the opportunity to review its content as it advances through the production process. Alpha Book files are updated on a regular basis in your account as new material is completed, all the way through final publication.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lots of valuable people put her/his effort on this book, especially the acquisitions editor Gwenan Spearing, coordinating editor Anamika Panchoo, development editor Chris Nelson, technical reviewer Robert Swafford, copy editor Tom McCarthy. I would like to thank all of them and the others who made it possible to produce this high quality resource.</p>
<p>We have still a few chapters to complete but we would love to get feedback for the currently available pieces. Go and participate the alpha program and get access to the early bits and completed chapters of the Pro ASP.NET Web API book. Don&rsquo;t hesitate to reach out to me in any way to give feedback :)</p>
