<p>Yesterday, I received an awesome e-mail telling me that I have been given <a href="http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/findanmvp/Pages/profile.aspx?MVPID=9d0ed4d0-65e1-49f5-b634-ebdef05f63c3">the Microsoft MVP award on ASP.NET/IIS</a>. :) This was obviously a great news for me because this is my first time being an MVP. If you wonder what the heck is Microsoft MVP Award program is, here is the quote from the official <a href="http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/about-mvp/Pages/default.aspx">MVP Overview</a> page:</p>
<p><em>"The Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) Award is our way of saying thank you to exceptional, independent community leaders who share their passion, technical expertise, and real-world knowledge of Microsoft products with others.</em></p>
<p><em>Nearly two decades ago, we awarded 37 technical community leaders as MVPs. Today, there are more than 4,000 MVPs worldwide. They represent more than 90 countries, speak over 40 languages, answer more than 10 million questions a year, and are awarded in almost 90 Microsoft technologies&mdash;reflecting the breadth of our products and our global communities."</em></p>
<p>Microsoft developer community is beyond huge. So many brilliant developers share their knowledge through blogs, webcasts, podcasts, conference talks, user group meetings. Being part of this community has been always a fun but with this award, this fun is now doubled. However, I have never seen the MVP award as a target. I didn&rsquo;t do anything special to get this award (well, except for filling the evaluation form). I just did what I love and that was enough. I love spending time on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stackoverflow</a>, I love writing blog posts and I love helping others if I can.</p>
<p>Nearly for four years now, I have been trying to find my way with ASP.NET and its sub components, such as <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc">ASP.NET MVC</a>, <a href="http://www.asp.net/web-api">ASP.NET Web API</a>, <a href="https://github.com/SignalR/SignalR">SignalR</a> and I can see that the product has been evolved so much in a positive direction. Not to mention some huge steps that have been taken such as making nearly the 90% of <a href="http://aspnetwebstack.codeplex.com/">the ASP.NET stack open source on Codeplex</a>. Being able to see how the product grows commit by commit is simply awesome. This improvements made it possible for me to create better software solutions for the company I work for. Besides that, other Microsoft products such as <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com">Window Azure</a> took me and my company to the next level.</p>
<p>I would like to especially thank all the developers at Microsoft, especially the ASP.NET, IIS and Windows Azure team members for the great products they build and the continuous support whenever we need it. I also want to thank all of the developers in this community for sharing their valuable knowledge, answering questions on forums and Q&amp;A sites. I should admit that I am learning a lot by looking at other people&rsquo;s code and if they weren&rsquo;t sharing those, I wouldn&rsquo;t be the developer as I am today.</p>
<p>Lastly, I would like to thank my lovely fianc&eacute; Nihan for her support in my life; especially for listening to me talking about tech stuff even if she has no idea about what I say 99% of the time. :)</p>
<p>I am hoping that I will never lose this award and I want to keep getting it every year :)</p>
