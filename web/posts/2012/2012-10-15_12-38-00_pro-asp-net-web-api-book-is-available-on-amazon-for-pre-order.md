<p>Two days ago, I blogged about the <a href="https://www.tugberkugurlu.com/archive/pro-asp-net-web-api-book-is-available-through-apress-alpha-program">availability of the Pro ASP.NET Web API Book through Apress Alpha Program</a>. It was a very valuable blog post for me because this is my first book. Today, I can tell you that you can pre-order <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430247258/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1430247258&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=tugsblo0c-20">Pro ASP.NET Web API book on Amazon</a><img style="margin: 0px; border-style: none !important;" border="0" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=tugsblo0c-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1430247258" width="1" height="1" /> and it will be delivered to you when it is available.</p>
<p>In this post, I would like to also give you some information about the book that we are writing. Pro ASP.NET Web API will guide you how to build flexible, extensible web services that run seamlessly on a range of operating systems and devices, from desktops to tablets to smart phones.</p>
<p>We also plan the book to consist of mainly three parts. In Part I, you'll get up to speed on Web API's modern HTTP programming model, asynchronous programming in .NET framework and basic HTTP information. Part II takes you through building a real application so you can see straight away how to put this new technology into practice. The second half of the book features dedicated chapters on topics like routing, controllers, validation and tracing, and we will have chapters on performance, security and an all-important look at unit testing to help you prepare your application for the real world.</p>
<p>ASP.NET Web API makes HTTP a first-class citizen of .NET. With Pro ASP.NET Web API, you will learn how to build HTTP-based web services for your company or business, expose your data to the world across different formats and devices and gain the best possible global reach for your application.</p>
<p>We have still a few chapters to complete but we work hard to get it done as soon as possible. I hope you will enjoy the book <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-style: none;" alt="Smile" src="https://www.tugberkugurlu.com/Content/images/Uploadedbyauthors/wlw/660be0c0773f_101CD/wlEmoticon-smile.png" /></p>
