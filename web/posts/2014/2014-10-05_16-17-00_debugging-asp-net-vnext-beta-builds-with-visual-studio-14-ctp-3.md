title: Debugging ASP.NET vNext Beta Builds with Visual Studio 14 CTP 3
abstract: Visual Studio CTP 3 has launched a while back and I was expecting to have
  trouble working with ASP.NET vNext beta builds. I was partially right. I wasn’t
  able to run the web application from Visual Studio. However, it’s still possible
  to debug the application and I have a workaround for you :)
