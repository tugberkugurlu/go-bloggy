title: A C# Developer's First Thoughts on MongoDB
abstract: After working with RavenDB over the year, I just started looking into MongoDB.
  I worked with MongoDB a year ago or so in a small project but my knowledge was mostly
  rusty and I don't want that to happen again :) So, here I'm, documenting what my
  second thoughts are :)
