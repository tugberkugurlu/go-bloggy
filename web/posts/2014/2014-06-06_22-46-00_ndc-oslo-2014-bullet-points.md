<p>This year, I decided not to miss on awesome <a href="http://ndcoslo.oktaset.com/">developer conference NDC</a> in Oslo and well, I attended! I'm actually still in Norway and I can tell that by looking at my pocket. I'm basically broken in terms of money :) Don't go to conferences if the city is ranked at the top of the World's most expensive cities (kidding, take a loan and go to NDC). If you miss this awesome developer conference, don't worry that much. <a href="http://vimeo.com/channels/ndc2014">The videos are already available online</a> and I'm actually watching couple of the ones that I missed.</p> <blockquote lang="en" class="twitter-tweet"> <p>The only session I missed and cried! How I hacked my way to Norway <a href="http://t.co/pK0vtgn9Dj">http://t.co/pK0vtgn9Dj</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt">@troyhunt</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ndcoslo&amp;src=hash">#ndcoslo</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ndc2014&amp;src=hash">#ndc2014</a></p>â€” Tugberk Ugurlu (@tourismgeek) <a href="https://twitter.com/tourismgeek/statuses/475033286830346240">June 6, 2014</a></blockquote><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p>During the event, a few things were highlighted by many people over and over again which also made sense to me. Since this was a developer conference crowded by the World's top notch software developers, these are worth pointing out as bullet points for developers like me:</p> <ul> <li>Mobile matters a lot (kind of obvious but worth highlighting it)!  <li>JavaScript is big! No matter what programming language you use and what kind of development you do, it's going to end pretty badly for you if you keep ignoring JavaScript.  <li>Learn a functional programming language. If you are a developer, you should (and I should) learn a functional programming language. It's kind of unavoidable in a World where concurrency matters this much.  <li>Don't develop for the management, develop for the users of your product and your team mates (current and future).  <li>SQL is still there but practically dead (there I said it!).  <li>This is only what I felt during these days: you cannot survive in a software industry if you only know one general purpose programming language (well, you probably will but I don't think you will really *survive*. Catching my drift?).  <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Swift</a> (not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift">Taylor Swift</a>) is a joke but it will be loved.</li></ul> <p>These are just my thoughts during these 3 days and the time will tell us whether those are actually valid points.</p>
