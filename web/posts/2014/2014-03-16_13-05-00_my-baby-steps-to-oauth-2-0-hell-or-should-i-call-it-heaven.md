title: My Baby Steps to OAuth 2.0 Hell (or Should I Call It Heaven)
abstract: Securing our HTTP API endpoints are one of the biggest challenges we face
  when writing so-called modern applications and this is where the OAuth 2.0 enters.
  In this post, I will highlight the things that I have found vital for the last couple
  of months when I have been working on an OAuth 2.0 Server implementation in .NET
  Framework.
