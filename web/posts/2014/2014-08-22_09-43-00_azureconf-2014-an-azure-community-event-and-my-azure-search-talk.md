<p>I proud to say that I will be giving a talk on <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/services/search/">Azure Search</a>, fully managed, cloud-based service that allows developers to build rich search applications using REST APIs, at <a href="https://www.azureconf.net/">AzureConf 2014</a>! AzureConf is a community event hosted by Microsoft and it will be streamed live on the 21st of October, 2014.  <p><a href="https://tugberkugurlu.blob.core.windows.net/bloggyimages/63ba8ec6-018e-4405-8662-02a565c40203.jpg"><img title="azureconf_1021_banner_743x200" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="azureconf_1021_banner_743x200" src="https://tugberkugurlu.blob.core.windows.net/bloggyimages/f9e11600-704b-449f-9e04-98acf80b4c63.jpg" width="644" height="176"></a></p> <p>Here is what AzureConf actually is all about:</p> <blockquote> <p>On October 21st, 2014, Microsoft will be hosting AzureConf, another free event for the Azure community. This event will feature a keynote presentation by Scott Guthrie, along with numerous sessions executed by Azure community members. Streamed live for an online audience on <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/">Channel 9</a>, the event will allow you to see how developers just like you are using Azure to develop robust, scalable applications on Azure. Community members from all over the world will join known speakers such as Michael Collier, Mike Martin, Rick Garibay, and Chris Auld in the Channel 9 studios to present their own inventions and experiences. Whether you’re just learning Microsoft Azure or you've already achieved success on the platform, you won’t want to miss this special event.</p></blockquote> <p>As said, the event will be streamed live and you need to register through the <a href="http://azureconf.net">AzureConf</a> web site.
