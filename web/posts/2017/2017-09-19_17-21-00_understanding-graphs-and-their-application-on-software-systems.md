title: Understanding Graphs and Their Application on Software Systems
abstract: Lately, I wanted to spend a little bit time on going back to fundamental
  computer science concepts.  I am going to start with Graphs, specifically Depth
  First Traversal (a.k.a. Depth First Search or DFS) and Breadth First Traversal (a.k.a
  Breadth First Search or BFS). However, this post is only about the definition of
  Graph and its application in software systems.
