title: Distributed Caching in .NET Core with PostSharp and Redis
abstract: On my previous post, I walked through the benefits of using PostSharp for
  caching in a .NET Core server application, by making it work on a single node application.
  In this post, we will see how we can enable Redis as the caching backend through
  PostSharp's modular nature.
