title: Declarative Coding Approach to Caching in .NET Core with PostSharp
abstract: PostSharp is a .NET library which gives you ability to program in a declarative
  style and allows you perform many cross-cutting concerns with a minimum amount of
  code by abstracting away the complexity from you. In this post, I will be looking
  into how PostSharp helps us for caching to speed up the performance of our applications
  drastically.
