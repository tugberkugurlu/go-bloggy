I opened a question called <strong><em>I'm looking for other's opinion on Scott Hanselman Facts </em></strong>on <a target="_blank" href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com" title="meta.stackoverflow.com">meta.stackoverflow.com</a> and it took seconds to be closed and minutes to be deleted <img src="http://tugberkugurlu.com/content/images/uploadedbyauthors/wlw/40f9cba43735_14BB9/wlEmoticon-sadsmile.png" alt="Sad smile" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-sadsmile" style="border-style: none;" /> what a mean thing! So thank you guys.</p>
<p>Well, I figured nobody could close this topic here so let&rsquo;s ask the question again here <img src="http://tugberkugurlu.com/content/images/uploadedbyauthors/wlw/40f9cba43735_14BB9/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-style: none;" /></p>
<p>Everybody knows that <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/9134/jon-skeet-facts">Jon Skeet Facts</a> has been discused long time ago and there were <a href="http://www.chucknorrisfacts.com/">Chuck Norris Facts</a> style answers.</p>
<p>I'm looking for the same thing for <a href="http://hanselman.com/blog">Scott Hanselman</a></p>
<p>Here are some of them that I can think of;</p>
<ol>
<li>He hates Northwind. </li>
<li>He dies for a diet soda. </li>
<li>He is a diabetic. </li>
<li>He watches Undercovers regularlly (as far as I know from his twitter posts) </li>
<li>He got lost in Munich ones when he was headed to a keynote. </li>
<li>He created most of the parts of <a target="_blank" href="http://nerddinner.com" title="Nerddiner.Com">Nerddinner.Com</a> </li>
<li>He likes to tweet. </li>
<li>He has a podtcsat called <a target="_blank" href="http://hanselminutes.com/" title="hanselminutes.com">hanselminutes</a> </li>
<li>He has another podcast with Rob Conory called <a target="_blank" href="http://thisdeveloperslife.com/" title="thisdeveloperslife.com">thisdeveloperslife.com</a> </li>
<li>He pops up before ScottGu on Google by googling 'scott'.</li>
<li>He likes to google with bing.</li>
<li>CRUD is one of his favourite words.</li>
<li>He used to work for an online bankking company. </li>
<li>He is working for Microsoft in the meantime. </li>
<li>He talks to himself while writing class properties (the freaking part here is that he enjoys it a lot)</li>
<li>If he ever gets the yellow screen of death, he gets it because he means it. </li>
<li>Once, he gets his wife's ring out of the pipeline like a plumber. </li>
<li>His family has a thing called <em>'Mummy &amp; Daddy Day'</em> which I will certainly imitate the idea in the future. </li>
<li>He could make an entire e-commerce web application for Tacos.</li>
<li>He is the only guy who could make Ninja moves with Windows 7</li>
<li>He can speak German better than Germans.</li>
</ol>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I can think of for now <img src="http://tugberkugurlu.com/content/images/uploadedbyauthors/wlw/40f9cba43735_14BB9/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-style: none;" /> I&rsquo;ll add them as comments if new things pops up in my head. So fire your thoughts guys. Let&rsquo;s have fun.</p>
