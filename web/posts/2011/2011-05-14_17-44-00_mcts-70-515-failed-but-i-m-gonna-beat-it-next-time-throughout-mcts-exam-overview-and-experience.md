<p>Couple of days ago (actually a week ago on the 7<sup>th</sup> of May), I took the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?ID=70-515&amp;locale=en-us" title="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?ID=70-515&amp;locale=en-us">Exam 70-515, TS: Web Applications Development with Microsoft .NET Framework 4</a> to be qualified as MCTS guy but it didn&rsquo;t go smoothly as I assumed and I failed <img src="http://tugberkugurlu.com/Content/images/UploadedByAuthors/wlw/MCTS_13DE7/wlEmoticon-confusedsmile.png" alt="Confused smile" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-confusedsmile" style="border-style: none;" /> It was ok though. The experience it has given me was enough to encourage me to go and discover all the other goodness of ASP.NET and it&rsquo;s children (AJAX and all that stuff). <strong>700 </strong>points should be taken to pass the exam but mine was <strong>546</strong>.</p>
<p>Actually, my exam number was 72-515. If you have taken the 072 exams before, you&rsquo;d know that they are Microsoft Academic exams for students and a small discount is applicable with those exams. In terms of questions and qualification which will you get, there is no difference between 070 and 072 exams.</p>
<p>For those who don&rsquo;t know what MCTS is, here is a quick overview;</p>
<p><strong>MCTS Overview</strong></p>
<p>The Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist (MCTS) certifications provide the foundation for Microsoft Certification. These certifications are designed to validate your skills on the features and functionality of key technologies. You can show your depth of knowledge in one specific technology, earn multiple MCTS certifications to show breadth across different products, or build on the MCTS to earn a Microsoft Certified IT Professional (MCITP) certification.</p>
<p><strong>MCTS candidate profile</strong></p>
<p>MCTS candidates are capable of implementing, building, troubleshooting, and debugging a particular Microsoft technology.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>When I found about these exams, I haven&rsquo;t had a single hard time to figure out which direction should I go or what is the best suitable exam for me. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/cert-default.aspx" title="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/cert-default.aspx">Microsoft exams are well documented on their website</a> and also there is a <a target="_blank" href="http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en/CertGeneral/threads" title="http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en/CertGeneral/threads">&lsquo;Training and Learning&rsquo; section up on social Microsoft</a>.</p>
<p>When you pass an MCTS exam, you will be qualified to get a certificate on the topic that you have taken the exam of. But also, MCTS exams for .Net developers are also the steps which will lead us to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/mcpd.aspx" title="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/mcpd.aspx">MCPD</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Quick Overview of MCPD</strong></p>
<p>The Microsoft Certified Professional Developer (MCPD) certification validates a comprehensive set of skills that are necessary to deploy, build, optimize, and operate applications successfully by using Microsoft Visual Studio and the Microsoft .NET Framework. The MCPD certification is designed to provide hiring managers with a strong indicator of your potential job success. It requires two to three years of relevant experience and a commitment to remaining current in best practices and technologies.</p>
