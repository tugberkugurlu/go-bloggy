If you are one of those, stop writing code and go write child novels) </em>and they are thrown every year by Microsoft. <strong><a target="_blank" rel="http://live.visitmix.com/" href="http://live.visitmix.com/" title="http://live.visitmix.com/">MIX11</a></strong> is just a few months ahead of us and this year, it will take place in Mandalay Bay, Las Vegas between 12th of April and 14<sup>th</sup> of April. For those who has no idea what I am talking about, here is a brief overview of MIX which was quoted from <a href="http://live.visitmix.com/About">http://live.visitmix.com/About</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>MIX is a unique opportunity to engage with Microsoft and industry professionals in a two-way conversation about the future of web - from the diversity of devices and interaction models on the front-end, to the tools and technologies that power the user experience, to the services that make it all possible.</em></p>
<p><em>MIX is for professionals who design and build cutting-edge websites. </em><a href="http://live.visitmix.com"><em>http://live.visitmix.com</em></a></p>
<em><strong>PREVIEW THE NEXT WEB</strong> </em>
<p><em>Learn about the future of web, from the diversity of devices and interaction models on the front-end, to the tools and technologies that power the user experience, to the services that make it all possible. There&rsquo;s no better place to hear about the future of Silverlight, Internet Explorer, Windows Phone, ASP.NET, and technologies like HTML5 and CSS3.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>GET REAL ANSWERS FROM THE EXPERTS</em></strong></p>
<p><em>MIX isn&rsquo;t just about getting a first look at the latest technologies and trends &ndash; it&rsquo;s an opportunity for you to have your questions answered by industry and Microsoft experts.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I thought that there could be an easy way for students to live those sessions where they happen. So I have searched (this is a Microsoft event so I thought that would be only legitimate if I <strong><em>Google</em></strong> it with <strong><em>Bing <img src="https://www.tugberkugurlu.com/content/images/uploadedbyauthors/wlw/2ae0a318492c_12B34/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" style="border-style: none;" width="19" height="19" /></em></strong>) and nothing has come up and decided to try to get information by e-mail.</p>
<p>MIX registration team replied me at the same they with tons of information and I didn&rsquo;t know that MIX has this kind of great deals for students.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Before diving deep, I would like to indicate that I have asked MIX registration team for the permission to publish the content of e-mail they have sent me on my blog so that the others can be aware of this opportunity and they kindly accept my request.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My question was so straight and their answer was so informative;</p>
<p><strong>Q : </strong>I am a student on Travel Management, in Turkey and I would like to know if you have any discounts for students on MIX11 or not.</p>
<p><strong>A : </strong>The academic rate is for full-time students and full-time staff of the academic community at the time of MIX11 with proof of enrollment or employment from an accredited educational institution. The cost to attend with a code is <strong>$595</strong> and covers the regular conference fee only; Pre-Conference Boot Camps and hotel accommodations are additional.</p>
<p>Given the original cost which is <strong>$1395</strong>, this deal is pretty perfect. Of course you need to prove that you are eligible for the discount. How so? They informed me before I asked! Pretty gorgeous. The process is as indicated below;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008000;" color="#008000">Students</span></strong></p>
<p>College, university, and career state-accredited school students qualify to register for MIX11 using the academic discounted rate with an acceptable form of academic ID.&nbsp; Please provide one of the following to prove that you are a current, full-time student:</p>
<ul>
<li>Official dated, current class schedule indicating name of school and student </li>
<li>Official dated, current school tuition bill indicating name of school and student (please black-out tuition cost and any other personal information) </li>
<li>Official dated, current report card indicating name of school and student </li>
<li>Other official dated, current proof of enrollment indicating name of school and student </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #008000;" color="#008000"><strong>Faculty / Staff</strong></span></p>
<p>College, university, and career state-accredited faculty and staff members qualify to register for MIX11 using the academic discounted rate with an acceptable form of academic ID.&nbsp; Please provide one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Official, current faculty/staff paycheck stub indicating full-time employment (please black-out salary information and any other personal information) </li>
<li>Official, current letter on school letterhead verifying person&rsquo;s full-time employment </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are an eligible academic and would like to attend MIX11, you need to submit your form of academic ID in one of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fax a photocopy of academic ID to 1-206-783-5594     <br />--OR--</li>
<li>Email a scanned image of academic ID to <a href="mailto:MIX11@ustechs.com">MIX11@ustechs.com</a> in JPG, PDF or GIF format</li>
</ul>
<p>After you complete those above steps, the process is going to be like below according to MIX Registration team;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Once we receive your valid proof of academic ID, we will provide you with an RSVP code to register.&nbsp; Please note you will need to bring the original form of academic ID in addition to a current valid photo ID with you to the event and show it at the time of registration.&nbsp; Failure to provide valid proof of eligibility is the responsibility of the registrant, and the registrant is responsible for their hotel and travel plans.</em></p>

I would say that is a perfect deal to catch for students and this kind of events are the best way to integrate with Microsoft developers.</p>
<p>Pack your stuff, and get ready for those geek sessions <img src="https://www.tugberkugurlu.com/content/images/uploadedbyauthors/wlw/2ae0a318492c_12B34/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" style="border-style: none;" width="19" height="19" /></p>
<p>Owww, I almost forgot. If you&rsquo;ll be there for MIX, don&rsquo;t forget to put the picture (just on the left side) on your blog to inform others that you will be there <img src="https://www.tugberkugurlu.com/content/images/uploadedbyauthors/wlw/2ae0a318492c_12B34/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" style="border-style: none;" width="19" height="19" /></p>
<p>This is cool way to say <em>&ldquo;Hey, I am a geek and I am proud of it&hellip;&rdquo;</em></p>
