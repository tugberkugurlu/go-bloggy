<p align="left">A few days ago, <a title="http://haacked.com" href="http://haacked.com" target="_blank">Phil Haack</a> made an announcement which wasn&rsquo;t a kind of announcement that we had heard from Mr. Haack. It wasn&rsquo;t a new product release or new version of <a title="http://asp.net/mvc" href="http://asp.net/mvc" target="_blank">ASP.NET MVC</a> or <a title="http://nuget.org" href="http://nuget.org" target="_blank">NuGet</a>. It wasn&rsquo;t the birthday of one of his children either. It was the announcement which tells us a very bad news. It was telling that <a title="http://haacked.com/archive/2011/11/28/departing-microsoft.aspx" href="http://haacked.com/archive/2011/11/28/departing-microsoft.aspx" target="_blank">he won&rsquo;t be working on behalf of Microsoft after the 5th of December 2011</a>.</p>
<p align="left">The blog post was sad for me and at the same time it was shocking as well. But none of those are the reason why I write about it here. I have no idea what happened and drew him away from Microsoft but I can tell that the blog post he has written is exemplary.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Phil Haack respects the place he worked and he didn&rsquo;t shit all over the company. </strong>This should be always the case even if you experienced the hell there.</p>
<p align="left">If you work on a company for a particular period of time and realize that this company is a shitty place after that period of time, you have a serious problem in my opinion. This behavior is no different than seeing your ex-wife / ex-husband as a monster, enemy after a divorce.</p>
<p align="left">Why am I writing this? I honestly don&rsquo;t know. But <a title="http://www.misfitgeek.com/2011/09/whats-wrong-with-microsoft/" href="http://www.misfitgeek.com/2011/09/whats-wrong-with-microsoft/" target="_blank">when I saw the blog post of Joe Stanger about the Microsoft</a>, I was really sad that a person like him can be a person like that. <a title="http://www.misfitgeek.com/2011/09/my-last-day-at-the-evil-empire-%E2%80%93-free-from-the-borg-collective/" href="http://www.misfitgeek.com/2011/09/my-last-day-at-the-evil-empire-%E2%80%93-free-from-the-borg-collective/" target="_blank">The announcement of his leave was a little harsh as well</a>.&nbsp; The title of the first blog post I referenced is 'What&rsquo;s wrong with Microsoft?'. The company name is not important here. It could be Apple, Starbucks or The Jim&rsquo;s Coffee House. The point here is that: this company was perfect when the employee was working there and it suddenly turned out a shitty place just after the employee left. Maybe it was a shitty place for a while when the employee worked there and he knew that but I, as a person in public, have no idea about that. <em>If you don&rsquo;t have guts to tell the same thing <strong>publicly</strong> when you work there, keep it to yourself for your entire life. </em>No matter what happened, that place is the company you have worked for. At some point, maybe the place you have represented for.</p>
<p align="left">So, don&rsquo;t be a slave of your angers. Don&rsquo;t go public without thinking by using the words you will possibly regret. Also, don&rsquo;t forget this is just a random dude&rsquo;s opinion on the internet.</p>
<p align="left">Oww, I almost forgot. I know that you are not dying but we, at least I, will miss you anyway <a title="http://twitter.com/Haacked" href="http://twitter.com/Haacked" target="_blank">@Haacked</a>!</p>
